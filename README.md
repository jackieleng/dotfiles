# dotfiles
Just some dotfiles

``install.sh`` is used to install and symlink the files (will only work when
started in the repo dir)

Everything in the home dir is symlinked to home directory (~).

Other things to do:

    $ ln -s /home/jackie/dircolors-solarized/dircolors.ansi-dark /home/jackie/.dircolors

    $ pip install neovim   # for python support in neovim
